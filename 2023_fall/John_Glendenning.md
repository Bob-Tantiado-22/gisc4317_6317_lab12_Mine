**Project Description**  

From location data (latitude / longitude) in a csv file, pull elevation data from online sources.  Segregate data by time period based on user input.  Test to see if there is a difference between the time periods (ANOVA / Tukey's HSD test).  Output data into usable formats including shapefiles, csv and pdfs.
